Learning-to-Rank User Reviews in the E-commerce Domain. A Comparative Study of Neural Network-Based Approaches and Large Language Models. 


## Description



The explosive growth of e-commerce platforms has led to an abundance of user-generated reviews, making it challenging for consumers to make informed decisions. Ranking these reviews is crucial to ensure that the most relevant and helpful information is presented to users. This thesis aims to conduct a comprehensive comparative study between state-of-the-art neural network-based approaches for learning to rank and large language models, like GPT and its successors, for the purpose of ranking user reviews in the e-commerce domain.



**Research questions**:

* Performance Comparison: How do neural network-based approaches for learning to rank, such as RankNet, LambdaRank, and LambdaMART, compare to large language models, like GPT-3 and its successors, in terms of ranking the relevance and helpfulness of user reviews in e-commerce?
* Differential Learning to Rank Requirements: Are there significant differences in the learning to rank requirements and effectiveness between search engine result pages (SERPs) and customer reviews in the e-commerce domain? How do these differences impact the choice between neural network-based approaches and large language models for ranking in each context?
* Training Data Requirements: What is the impact of the quantity and quality of training data on the performance of neural network-based approaches and large language models for review ranking? Does one approach require more extensive data or exhibit a higher degree of sensitivity to data quality?
* Generalisation and Adaptability: How well do the two approaches generalise to different e-commerce domains, product categories, and languages? Are large language models more adaptable and versatile in comparison to other neural network-based approaches?
* Scalability and Resource Requirements: What are the computational resource requirements for both approaches in terms of training and inference? How do these requirements impact their feasibility for practical deployment in e-commerce platforms, particularly for smaller businesses?
* Ethical Considerations: What are the ethical concerns associated with using large language models for ranking user reviews, such as bias, privacy, and security, and how do they compare to neural network-based approaches in this context?
* Hybrid Approaches: Can a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of neural network-based methods and large language models be developed to optimise review ranking in the e-commerce domain? What are the benefits and challenges of such hybridisation?

 ## Work Environment

 

 The thesis will be supervised by [Barrie Kersbergen](https://bkersbergen.github.io/) and [dr. Sebastian Schelter](https://ssc.io) and the student will join the [AI for Retail Lab](https://icai.ai/airlab/), which is a joint research effort between the [Information Retrieval Lab](https://irlab.science.uva.nl/) and the [Intelligent Data Engineering Lab](https://indelab.org) at the UvA.  Our lab includes several PhD students and research engineers with a varied set of interests and expertise revolving around applied machine learning and scalable data management.
 
 ## Expectations

 
This is an ambitious project for a **self-motivated student capable of critical thinking** and willing to take on a research-heavy thesis. The student is expected to develop a written structured work plan, and discuss updates in regular meetings with the supervisor. 



It is strongly encouraged to publish the resulting analysis and software under an open source license. Furthermore, the thesis may result in a publication at a high-quality data engineering or ML conference, which has often happened in the past for student projects supervised within our group.



Required technical skills:

 * Basic understanding of data engineering and machine learning

* Experience with Python, pandas and git

* Strong programming skills for working with a variety of potentially dirty datasets


Optional technical skills (can be acquired during the project):

 * Understanding of common neural network architectures

 * Ability to work with neural network frameworks
